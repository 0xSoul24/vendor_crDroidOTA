crDroid 10.2-r2

Changes since v10.2 (15 February) release:
- Still on February 2024 Android Security Bulletin (android-14.0.0_r25).
- Upstream changes from LineageOS:
  - Rebased on end-of-March lineage-21 branches for our devices (including switching to bluetooth AIDL, surprised me there).
  - Probably more updated Lineage 21 apps, I dunno.
- Upstream changes from crDroid ROM sources:
  - I dunno, whatever they had to do to incorporate all the lineage-21.0 official release changes mid-month.
  - Seems we're just defaulting to using jemalloc everywhere now. Okay I guess... less hardened, slightly faster.
  - I dunno if we changed device fingerprint again for Play Integrity, but wouldn't surprise me.
  - Probably more things. I last synced my build trees with ROM sources the day before QPR2 merge went live at LineageOS.
- Device-specific (buckle up):
  - A million "10.2-next" builds testing a variety of things you'll never see while waiting for Android 14 QPR2 to get merged & Lineage to rebase and crDroid to rebase.
  - Shrank reserved size for GApps in system partition again to accommodate vendor getting yet-larger, so we're at ~1.2GB available for Google Apps now... but it actually WORKS (see below).
  - FINALLY fixed a months-old problem with the NikGapps "crdroid-official" elite package (or anything else that was larger than a certain threshold) not flashing completely after the switch to dynamic partitioning. Something something inode count; now it actually calculates available space remaining correctly mid-install of addons.
  - Complete overhaul of power/performance stuff across kernel, device tree, and hardware interfaces.
    - Moving to EdwinMoq's v4 power-libperfmgr AIDL imported from Pixel in hardware/oneplus/, it behaves a little different but seems to work.
    - Go back to explicitly removing more qcom perfd-related bits in kernel (I don't care if it's more in-line with 4.19; it'll need to get removed there as well eventually), among other changes.
    - Look, I don't even know how to describe it all. Read the commit histories. Things should be more power-friendly, and still maintaining performance. It's all the testing on all the interrim branches where figuring it out was taking place, even if the actual changes aren't massive overall.
  - Hopefully fix some camera crashing/kernel panics (just... don't ask... mistakes were made).
- "Misc tweaks & bugfixes." :D

General Notes:
- I know the power consumption situation was pretty bad in 10.2 first release, and people were having problems with not actually being able to install full NikGapps "crdroid-official" package properly, and I'm sorry for the radio silence for 2 months.
- Power/perf & "why can't I install GApps?!" are basically the only things I've been working on this whole time, when I've had the time to work on the ROM at all.
- Now that things are happy again, I can try to move on with just skipping straight to working on a crDroid 10.4 release, so you all don't have to deal with all the features that got removed in 10.3 before the dev team figured out how to re-add them after the AOSP 14.0 QPR2 merge.

Known issues:
- Look, none of this is really deal-breaking for most people. Things work well as a daily driver, all major systems work as they should as far as I can tell (or at least as well as in upstream LineageOS).
- Upstream crDroid/LineageOS/Qualcomm/Google issues:
  - Blurs are very resource-intensive, and I can't disable them by default while keeping the capability intact. For best experience & battery life, go to Settings > Display and disable "window-level blurs". If you want it to look pretty without too much lag/stutter, go to Settings > DeviceExtras and turn "AdrenoBoost" all the way up to 3, but be aware this will consume more battery.
  - SAFETYNET/PLAY INTEGRITY IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO PASS FOR GOOGLE PAY/WALLET. Google has been on a rampage against custom ROMs and unlocked bootloaders being able to spoof Play Integrity in a meaningful way, and seems to be requiring hardware-backed integrity (which is currently not spoofable) for Pay/Wallet. It has always been a cat & mouse game, and they can change the rules on their end at any time. Currently a new install will show up with "Device Certified" in Play Store, but that might change any time and is not considered a bug. The ROM devs update the spoofed fingerprint, and it takes me forever to get updates releases pushed, and then it's out of date by the time you get it. Sorry. Hate Google, not me. Change to a better bank & use the website instead of a crappy "app", and complain loudly while you threaten to take your money somewhere else that doesn't make broken apps.
  - As of Android 13, we're using the source-built AOSP implementations for bluetooth & NFC, since it's not possible to continue with the old prebuilt QTI vendor blobs & implementation. Some things don't work as well; nothing I can do about it.
  - The "QR Code Scanner" lockscreen shortcut option does not get enabled for use until you add the "QR Scanner" QS tile.
  - Wallpapers & Styles can cause a SystemUI crash if you swap clock faces & colors too rapidly, too many times before settling on something. It's a stupid/funny reason, I hope devs can figure out what to DO about it. (not sure if this is still true?)
  - In landscape mode, the "split shade" code was changed in 10.2 and notifications might not appear (just grey rectangles where they should be). Go into "Settings > crDroid Settings > QS Tiles" and change the "Quick QS" columns or rows in landscape to something not-default (3 columns or 2 rows or something) and it should resolve. Might even work if you do that, back out of the setting, then set it back to defaults. This is fixed in newer sources (10.4) but I haven't built against updated sources yet post-14.0-QPR2-merge.
- crDroid OP6/6T-specific issues:
  - VP9 video playback has problems in Android 14 on sdm845 devices using the qcom-caf sdm845 media HAL & qualcomm hardware accelerated decoder. Disabling the hardware-accelerated decoder allows apps like YouTube & Instagram that change stream format mid-session to work correctly again, although playback of 1440p & 4K VP9-compressed content now requires software decoding fallback. TL;DR: you might need to use NewPipe to download 4K videos & VLC to play them now. This isn't just our device; anything using sdm845 or sdm710 or older is going to have problems in Android 14 with VP9 video format decoding in hardware, but whether a maintainer chooses to "fix" it by making it fall back to software decoding is going to be device-specific, so I'll put it here (since I did).
  - You should go into crDroid Home (default launcher) settings and disable "Shake to clear recents" feature. It seems buggy with our device's sensor implementation & causes bad lag/slowdown after a while when trying to switch apps/see recents/navigate home.
