crDroid 10.4

Changes since v10.2-r2 (23 April) release:
- Merge April 2024 Android Security Bulletin & Android 14.0 QPR2 (android-14.0.0_r31).
- Upstream changes from LineageOS:
  - Changes to support QPR2 (no it does not have backported BPF, Lineage devs basically reverted a lot of the "test for 4.19 and newer kernel, drop a lot of old code for old kernel compatibility" commits from AOSP).
  - Rebased on end-of-April lineage-21 branches for our devices (enchilada, fajita, oneplus/sdm845-common device tree, hardware/oneplus/, and merged kernel updates).
  - Change to using stereo mic (noise cancelling mode I think) for speakerphone for some mixer paths; see if WhatsApp & Signal work for you now if they didn't before I guess...?
- Upstream changes from crDroid ROM sources:
  - Merged QPR2, which meant a lot of features went away in 10.3 initially... then while the crDroid devs were busy trying to fix & re-add our customizations, less than two weeks later the April ASB dropped and it was a tiny update so they just merged it. 10.3. hardly existed, which is why we're going straight from 10.2r2 to 10.4. Most of the ROM-side features that will still work correctly have been dropped, fixed, and re-added. So if your favorite feature is now missing... sorry. Pour one out, remember the good old days, move on (unless you know how to fix it, in which case please feel free to author some commits, make a fork of crdroidandroid/android_frameworks_base, and open a pull request on GitHub!).
  - The dark-grey empty notification block issue in landscape mode has been fixed it seems, yay! If it's still being weird, you might need to go into Settings > crDroid Settings > Quick Settings, and restore some defaults.
  - Updated translations, various NPE fixes in frameworks, other optimizations, and re-adding features that were dropped initially in 10.3 when the QPR2 merge first landed (not that I ever released 10.3, but oh well).
  - I actually reverted the commit that adds "dun" APN type to default read-only types, so all the editing restrictions kinda basically magically fall away, and you can try to edit your carrier's provided APN (or a copy you create of it) to use IPv4/IPv6 instead of just IPv6 without losing the ability to do tethering. Will submit for inclusion in the official crDroid ROM sources if it tests well.
- Device-specific things I can't stop screwing around with:
  - Kernel base updated to last lineage-20-test branch courtesy of bananafunction (plus merge of lineage-21 branch from upstream LineageOS as well of course). He actually has passed his OP6(T?) on to someone else and is no longer going to be actively maintaining a 4.14 LTS / QUIC update backport branch any longer, so I guess... we are where we are.
  - Re-land a couple "revert these recent changes by qualcomm" commits from bananafunction that I accidentally previously undid by merging lineage-21 branch of our upstream LineageOS kernel, because they cause playback stuttering/excessive CPU/GPU usage.
  - Okay, for everyone who kept frothing about how amazing 10.2next5.1 was, fine. It looks like absolute crap in benchmarks & even jitter test. Whatever. I re-included the MCD kernel scheduler/governor changes in kernel, and a couple of the INTERACTION boosts in powerhint. It might be more power-hungry now, but I guess that means that the gawdawful QS/Notification shade code that Google has left us with in AOSP 14 will now animate faster. Stop trying to make 12 QS tiles visible at once and a lot of your problems will go away.
  - I didn't really want to include too many kernel haxx, but I guess it's all gonna be out the window with 4.19 anyway, so who cares. At least I have a good idea about where to begin with powerhint & Kconfig settings the next time I get back to that... and at least it won't require fugly backports to take proper advantage of uclamp in power-libperfmgr v4 AIDL.
  - Updated media_codecs_performance.xml based on xiaomi/sdm845-common in LineageOS.
  - At some point I reset AdrenoBoost default value to 1 again instead of zero. Seems to still be helpful, and we don't use the GPU very much in general so it's not really using much power to help with things feeling smoother.
- "Misc tweaks & bugfixes." :D

General Notes:
- Rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated. But I'm gonna be busy a lot, and the device might get dropped again through the summer & fall because I can only get around to finishing a testing/fixing/release cycle every other month this busy time of year.

Known issues:
- Look, none of this is really deal-breaking for most people. Things work well as a daily driver, all major systems work as they should as far as I can tell (or at least as well as in upstream LineageOS).
- Upstream crDroid/LineageOS/Qualcomm/Google issues:
  - Background blurring requires significant boosts to render smoothly. There's not currently a way to retain the capability for blurs but disable them by default that I can find. You should consider turning off the "window-level blurs" toggle in Settings > Display if you want to make things smoother & save battery.
  - SAFETYNET/PLAY INTEGRITY IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO PASS FOR GOOGLE PAY/WALLET. Google has been on a rampage against custom ROMs and unlocked bootloaders being able to spoof Play Integrity in a meaningful way, and seems to be requiring hardware-backed integrity (which is currently not spoofable) for Pay/Wallet. It has always been a cat & mouse game, and they can change the rules on their end at any time. Currently a new install will show up with "Device Certified" in Play Store, but that might change any time and is not considered a bug. The ROM devs update the spoofed fingerprint, and it takes me forever to get updates releases pushed, and then it's out of date by the time you get it. Sorry. Hate Google, not me. Change to a better bank & use the website instead of a crappy "app", and complain loudly while you threaten to take your money somewhere else that doesn't make broken apps.
  - As of Android 13, we're using the source-built AOSP implementations for bluetooth & NFC, since it's not possible to continue with the old prebuilt QTI vendor blobs & implementation. Some things don't work as well; nothing I can do about it.
  - The "QR Code Scanner" lockscreen shortcut option does not get enabled for use until you add the "QR Scanner" QS tile.
  - Wallpapers & Styles can cause a SystemUI crash if you swap clock faces & colors too rapidly, too many times before settling on something. It's a stupid/funny reason, I hope devs can figure out what to DO about it. (not sure if this is still true?)
- crDroid OP6/6T-specific issues:
  - You should go into crDroid Home (default launcher) settings and disable "Shake to clear recents" feature. It seems buggy with our device's sensor implementation & causes bad lag/slowdown after a while when trying to switch apps/see recents/navigate home.
